# [1771] Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences
# Difficulty: Hard
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-palindrome-length-from-subsequences
#
# You are given two strings, word1 and word2. You want to construct a string in the following manner:
#
# Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence1 from word1.
# Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence2 from word2.
# Concatenate the subsequences: subsequence1 + subsequence2, to make the string.
#
# Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner.
# If no palindromes can be constructed,return 0.
# A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from s without changing the order of the remaining characters.
# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwardÂ as well as backward.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba", which is a palindrome.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which is a palindrome.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000
# word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
#

    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        word = word1 + word2

                return 1
            if right < left:
                return 0
            if word[left] == word[right]:
                return 2 + dp(left + 1, right - 1)
            return max(dp(left + 1, right), dp(left, right - 1))

        ret = 0
        for letter in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
            left = word1.find(letter)
            right = word2.rfind(letter)
            if left != -1 and right != -1:
                ret = max(ret, dp(left, len(word1) + right))

        return ret
